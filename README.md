# Pip-boy Watch Face for WearOS Devices
#### Highly customizable Pip-boy themed watch face created in Watch Face Studio for WearOS Devices supporting SDK 30-34.
###### Based on an original face by universewithtin. 

  This is my first attempt at a custom watch face for WearOS devices. I tried my best to keep all of the design aspects as true to the in-game design of the pip-boy as possible while including as many features as possible. There are compatibility issues with the SDK 30 and 34 versions, please verify the SDK version of your watch before attempting to run the face through Watch Face Studio.
## Features:
- 6 face colors: Green/Amber/Blue/White/Red/Pink
- 9 logo options: Vault-Tec/Robco/BOS/Enclave/Institute/Nuka-Cola/Slocum Joe/Fallout/Fallout Lightning-bolt
- 10 icon options for Map complication
- 2 customizable complications
- Radio complication
- Battery complication with Low indicator, battery temp, and charge indicator
- DD/MM/YYYY Calendar complication with weekday, week of year, and day of year.
- 24-Hour clock with Timezone, Sunset/rise time, alarm complication, and stopwatch shortcut.
- Animated Vault-boy Walking/Resting/Reading
- HP Heart rate indicator Numerical/Progress bar 150-0
- RAD Step indicator Numerical/Progress bar percent of step goal
- AP flat leveling indicator.
- SDK 34: Weather Information: Condition, Moon Phase, Precipitation, Temp, UV index
- SDK 30: Messages/Settings Shortcut
#### Possible later additions if WFS software allows:
- Calorie indicator
