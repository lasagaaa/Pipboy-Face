# Pip-boy Watch Face for WearOS Devices
#### Highly customizable Pip-boy themed watch face created in Watch Face Studio for WearOS Devices supporting SDK 30-34.
###### Based on an original face by [universewithtin.](https://github.com/universewithtin)

  This is my first attempt at a custom watch face for WearOS devices. I tried my best to keep all of the design aspects as true to the in-game design of the pip-boy as possible while including as many features as possible. There are compatibility issues with the SDK 30 and 34 versions, please verify the SDK version of your watch before attempting to run the face through Watch Face Studio.
  
Feel free to give tips or make suggestions. They are greatly appreciated!
